#ok- so first you need to reproduce the results with double third order curve using the new code- study what happens in phenol_poly func and ndvi_phenol_poly vs. the new code and figure it out.

#Then, once you have reconciled the two, compare the third order curves with your other approach with model averaging, using the lognormal curve

#if the thirdorder curve continues to perform, you need to include first date of sampling in the table to illustrate the problem/solution- what determines when you start?

#also mention that using median vals isn't a fatal problem after all, and makes the most sense to me.
